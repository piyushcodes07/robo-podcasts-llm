"""
Text-to-speech conversion module for podcast generation.

This module handles the conversion of text scripts into natural-sounding speech using
multiple TTS providers (Google Cloud TTS and ElevenLabs). It includes functionality for:

- Rate limiting API requests to stay within provider quotas
- Exponential backoff retry logic for API resilience
- Processing individual conversation lines with appropriate voices
- Merging multiple audio segments into a complete podcast
- Managing temporary audio file storage and cleanup

The module supports different voices for interviewer/interviewee to create natural
conversational flow and allows configuration of voice settings and audio effects
through the PodcastConfig system.

Typical usage:
    config = PodcastConfig()
    convert_to_speech(
        config,
        conversation_script,
        'output.mp3',
        '.temp_audio/',
        'mp3'
    )

  - Steady and confident when explaining or analyzing.
  - Slightly dramatic when telling stories or adding punchlines.

üìà Intonation & Tone:
